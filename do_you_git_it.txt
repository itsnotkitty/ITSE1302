# So you want to know who I am?
		
	Good question, I guess I should start out with the fact that my name is **Eric Thomas Gorski!!**

	Aside from that there isn't all that much I am comfortable divulging. I am basically what many would refer to as a "gamer" this ranging from digital to Analogue game (board games, table top, etc...) Goal wise, I want to get into designing said games. I have spent the past year writing up a design document and teachingmyself, I however hit a wall with programing and figured that taking a class would help me. Hobbies i have onthe side include singing, playing piano, and just chilling and listening to some tunes. that is basically thejist of it.

# Version Control

	To put it bluntly and probably amatuerishly, version control allows you to keep track of various     states of a program thoughout it's development cycle.

		-allows several people to work on the same project and avoid incedental conflicts.
		-allows you to keep track of "version history" seeing who made changes, what they were
		 and what purpose these changes serve.
		- allows you to test changes before fully implementing it as a merge.
		-Creates the ability to go back to previous versions in necessary.

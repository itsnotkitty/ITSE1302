# So you want to know who I am?
		
	Good question, I guess I should start out with the fact that my name is **Eric Thomas Gorski!!**

	Aside from that there isn;t all that much I am comfortable divulging. I am basically what many     would refer to as a "gamer" this ranign from digital to Analogue game (board games, table top, etc...) Goal wise, I want to get into designing said games. I have spent the past year writing up a design document and teaching myself, I howeever hit a wall with programing and figured that taking a class would help me. Hobbies i have on the side include singing, playing piano, and just chilling and listening to some tunes. that is basically the jist of it.
